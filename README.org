This repo contains /no/ improvements over its parent repo, but it does build on modern VS. No longer as a compact .exe, but as an .exe that depends on a folder full of DLLs.

** What I've changed

- Removed all references to Costura/Fody, so that it builds on modern VS2022
- Removed all build tools for installer, since these will probably be broken

** What I might change in the future

- Modernise the code so it builds on modern versions of .NET, as a compact exe.
- Add some kind of makefile or way to build it on macOS
- Refactor the whole thing to Rust or something (wishful thinking)
